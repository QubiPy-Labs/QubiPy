# Security and Best Practices

!!! warning "Security Notice"
   While QubiPy provides tools to interact with the Qubic network, users are responsible for implementing proper security measures in their applications.

## Best Practices

### API Usage

!!! info "Rate Limiting"
   - Implement proper rate limiting in your applications
   - Handle API errors gracefully
   - Don't spam the network with unnecessary requests
   - Cache responses when appropriate

### Error Handling

!!! tip "Proper Error Management"
   ```python
   try:
       response = rpc_client.get_transaction_status(tx_id)
   except QubiPy_Exceptions as e:
       # Handle QubiPy specific errors
       logger.error(f"QubiPy error: {e}")
   except Exception as e:
       # Handle unexpected errors
       logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
   ```

### Transaction Safety

!!! danger "Critical Considerations"
   - Always verify transaction data before broadcasting
   - Double-check addresses and amounts
   - Keep private keys secure and never share them
   - Don't store sensitive information in code or version control

### Configuration Management

!!! tip "Environment Variables"
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Don't hardcode API endpoints or credentials
   - Keep production and development configurations separate

### Logging

!!! info "Logging Best Practices"
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Don't log sensitive information
   - Use appropriate log levels
   - Include relevant context in log messages

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

!!! warning "Don'ts"
   - Don't ignore API response validation
   - Don't catch all exceptions without proper handling
   - Don't store sensitive data in plaintext
   - Don't use deprecated methods
